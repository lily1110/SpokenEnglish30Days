   Success means different things for different people. Some may **equate it with fame**, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments. For me, it means **fulfilling** one's dreams. **Whatever** your dreams are, you have a goal there and then **focus all your attention on it**.
> equate sth with sth



> regard sth as sth



> fame, famous

> sense of accomplishments

> whatever, no matter what; whoever, wherever, whenever

> pay attention on, spare no effort to do/in doing

Dreams bring you hope and happiness. **In the process of** **struggling for** it, you cry, **sweat**, complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have **gone through**. So an old proverbs says that the sweeatest fruit is one that has **undergone** the bitterest **ordeal**.

> no sweat

> go through, thick and thin, undergo

> ordeal, hardship

> Love me, love my dog.

> Kill two birds with one stone.

> An eye for an eye. 

There are several **keys to** sucess. First, your goal must be practical and practicable.If you set your goal too high, **chances are** that you will never **attain it**. Next you have to make a plan of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it. Since the process is quit tough, you need to be diligent, patient and **persevering**.

> key to

> chances are that, it's possible

> diligent, hard working

> attain it

Even if you meet with some difficulties or **frustrations**, just take them in your stride. You can always tell yourself that there is nothing **insurmountable**. With this will and determination, success is sure to wait for you at the end of the tunnel!

> frustration frustrated

> take somthing in your stride, make strides in sth

> insurmountable
